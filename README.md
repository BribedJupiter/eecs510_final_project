# eecs510_final_project
Hello! This is the repository for my final project for EECS 510. In it, you will find all related project files. 
- **START HERE** -> *EECS_510_Final_Project.pdf* - This is the reference document where I explain Parts 1-5. It contains an explanation of the language, its grammar, the PDA diagram, an explanation of the data structure, and sample outputs for the test files. 
- *automaton.txt* - This contains the PDA represented using the data structure developed in Part 4 of the project.
- *main.py* - This contains the functions used to load the PDA and check input strings. You can run it by running
```python main.py``` in the project directory where it will then ask for an input string and you can enter the string you would like to test. I had success testing it with Python 3.10.14.
- *Figure1_PDA.png* - A screenshot of the PDA from the PDF. 
- */LaTeX* - This folder contains all LaTeX source files.
