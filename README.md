# eecs510_final_project
Hello! This is the repository for my final project for EECS 510. In it, you will find two main files. 
- **automaton.txt** contains the PDA represented using the data structure developed in Part 4 of the project.
- **main.py** contains the function used to load the PDA and check input strings. You can run it by running
```python main.py``` where it will then ask for an input string and you can enter the string you would like to test.
